# An Axiological Matrix for Brazilian Portuguese Bluesky Discourse on AI in Education

Anonymous artifact for the submitted paper **“An Axiological Matrix for Brazilian Portuguese Bluesky Discourse on AI in Education.”**

## Overview

The framework applies an applicability gate and then maps applicable posts by
acceptance and evaluative intensity. The main corpus contains **1,497 posts**:
**734 applicable** and **763 excluded**. Raw applicability agreement was
**0.8844**, with Cohen’s kappa **0.7701**. Exact-consensus subsets contain
**395 items** for the 3-class tasks and **244 items** for the 5-class tasks.

The external temporal projection contains **989 records** and **973 unique text
hashes**. The final linguistic audit identified **124 clearly non-Portuguese
records**; both applicability gates excluded all 124, so they entered neither
projected matrix.

## Human gold and validation

The formal decision flow is:

```text
independent annotation
→ review and calibration
→ effective A1/A2 labels
→ effective agreement or adjudication of remaining conflicts
→ final_applicability_score
```

The released validation package contains:

- 1,497 final applicability decisions;
- 733 applicable posts with valid axis labels from both annotators;
- 395 exact-consensus items for the 3-class tasks;
- 244 exact-consensus items for the 5-class tasks.

Final 100% applicability coverage is adjudication coverage, not independent
agreement. The 50-item 2024 challenge set is supplementary diagnostic material
and is not the supervised gold.

## Headline model results

- Applicability: BERTimbau, macro-F1 **0.9035 ± 0.0035**.
- Acceptance, 3 classes: BERTimbau **0.7463 ± 0.0124**; raw word
  LinearSVC **0.7460 ± 0.0093**.
- Intensity, 3 classes: BERTimbau **0.6644 ± 0.0086**.
- Acceptance, 5 classes: raw word LinearSVC **0.5609 ± 0.0097**.
- Intensity, 5 classes: raw character Logistic Regression
  **0.4718 ± 0.0368**.
